Maze Search Project with Java  

This program will read a maze from a file, and initially display it to the graphics window (entry location shown in yellow and exit location shown in green).  
Then, when the user hits any key, it will display the maze with a path through it shown in blue, or just the original maze if there is no possible path from the entrance to the exit. It will also give some indication of whether there was a path.

This is a friendly warning for students who are currently taking CSCI455:      
Do NOT copy the above code. The professor has strict checking process for your project. CSCI 455 is the best programming course (although it has a really heavey load). Try to grab hints from my code, but create a new and inspiring solution by your own.
