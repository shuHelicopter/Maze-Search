This is a friendly warning for students who are currently taking CSCI455:      
Do NOT copy the above code. The professor has strict checking process for your project. CSCI 455 is the best programming course (although it has a really heavey load). Try to learn from my code, and create a new and inspiring solution.  

By the way, please leave a 'star' if it's helpful. (Smile :) )
